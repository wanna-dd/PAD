**Adaptive Feedback Cross-loop Self-KD**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repo contains demonstrations of using Adaptive Feedback Cross-loop Self-KD (PAD) to adaptively optimize one-dimensional spectral information, especially in UV-vis, Raman, IR spectra.

This repository is adapted from the codebase used to produce the results in the paper **Adaptive Feedback Cross-loop for Preserving and Robust Spectral Information Optimization without 
Spectral Processing in Few-shot Learning** published in **Measurement Science and Technology (2025)** at **https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6501/aded2a**.

**Requirements**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code in this repo has been tested with the following software versions:

**Python** 3.8.13

**PyTorch** 2.3.1

**Cuda** 12.0.151

**Pycharm** 2024.1.4

We recommend using the Anaconda Python distribution, which is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

**Data Availablity**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The public Raman spectral dadaset for bacteria task in the experiment are available at **https://github.com/csho33/bacteria-ID.**

Other datasets are not publicly available due to agreements related to commerical senstivity, but can be made available from the correspondence author upon resonable request.
